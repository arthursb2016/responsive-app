# responsive-app [beta]

This package contains the core functionalities for plugins that will automatically handle your app responsiveness.

## Usage 

1. [Rollup and Vite plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-responsive-app) or
2. [Webpack plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-plugin-responsive-app)

This package will be installed as a dependency.

## Demo
The plugin will make sure your app proportions and relative sizes are all the same across all screen resolutions:

## How it's done

The plugin will:

1. Add [a script](https://github.com/arthursb2016/responsive-app/blob/master/src/script.ts) to your app entry point, which:
    1. Has 8kb
    2. Runs once the documet is ready
    3. Adds [css media queries](https://github.com/arthursb2016/responsive-app/blob/master/src/queries.ts)
    4. Adds centralization rules for mobile screens
    5. Adds the app transformations (pixels to rem) rules
    6. Adds an event listener the window resize, which updates the HTML tag font-size
2. Pre-process your CSS definitions: by creating new style rules that overwrite pixel definitos to the equivalent rem values
3. Notice the HTML font-size from your page to be different in each screen resolution. All properties with rem values will respond and adjust accordingly

## Beta phase

We are aiming to make the web responsive by one-line installation ðŸš€

Testing the solution across diversed contexts will enable us to make the solution the most comprehensive possible.

How to test:

1. Install either plugin (Rollup or Webpack) in your fresh or existing app
2. Check your interface across multiple resolutions
3. Then let me know how it worked for you :)

You can reach out to me in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/artsborba/) or open a Github issue to clear doubts, share feedback or demonstrate your context (either working or not)

Now check below the options you can pass to the plugin constructor:


## Options

You can pass an options object to the constructor:

| Name  | Type | Description | Default | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| ------------- |:-------------:|
| appEntry  | undefined \| string | Your application entry point | Will try to resolve as `index.html`, `app.js`, `main.js`, `bundle.js` or `src/index.js` | 
| transformPixels  | boolean \| TransformPixelsOptions | Convert `pixel` definitions to `rem` | true | 
| handleMobile  | boolean \| HandleMobileOptions | Auto-adapt the interface for mobile screens [experimental] | true |

#### TransformPixelsOptions

| Name  | Type | Description | Default | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| ------------- |:-------------:|
| ignoreAttributes  | string[] | List of CSS attributes to be bypassed. You can set as `['box-shadow', 'border-radius']` for example | [] | 
| ignoreSelectors  | string[] | List of CSS selectors to be bypassed| [] | 

#### HandleMobileOptions

| Name  | Type | Description | Default | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| ------------- |:-------------:|
| ignoreSelectors  | string[] | List of CSS selectors to be bypassed| [] | 
| centralizeText | string[] | List of elements to be centralized | ['h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', 'h6', 'p'] |
| breakpoint | string | Max screen width (when to consider as "mobile") | 480px


#### Bypassing transformations

You can also add the `ignore-responsive-app` class to any HTML element so the above transformations do not have effect. Example:

```HTML
<style>
.width-300 {
    width: 300px;
}
.width-300:not(.ignore-responive-app) {
    width: 18.75rem;
}
</style>

<div class="width-300 ignore-responsive-app">
  My width will remain in pixels!
</div>
```

Note: Inline styles transformations (e.g. `<div style="font-size: 24px">...` to `<div style="font-size: 1.5rem">...`) are not supported yet.
